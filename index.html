                <p> I spent the majority of Saturday watching college football. I woke up around 9:00,  showered, had some breakfast and a smoothie and then watched college game day up until the beginning of games. It was Michigan State’s Bye Week, and I didn’t work on Saturday, so I got to enjoy the weekend college football slate without any distractions or emotional attachments. </p>
                <p> The games I watched the early slate were Pittsburgh & Louisville, Georgia Tech & Wake Forest, Duke & Syracuse, and Notre Dame & Arkansas. One of my best friends goes to Pitt and was at the game, so he texts back and forth and lost today. I was surprised by the two ACC games, Georgia Tech just scraped by and Syracuse struggled with their backup quarterback. I think Arkansas’s head coach should be fired, they were that bad. </p>
                <p> The middle slate had some heavy hitters with Ohio State & Washington, LSU & Ole Miss, Indiana & Iowa, and Tennessee & Mississippi State. I believed Washington would put up a better fight, although they played well in the beginning and couldn't capitalize. My parents’ alma mater was Indiana, and they had a rough game at Iowa. Mississippi State lost in heartbreaking fashion in overtime, and LSU's offense looks terrible which is why they lost.</p>
                <p> The big night games were Oregon & Penn State and Alabama & Georgia. Even though it went to overtime, Oregon dominated Penn State and deserved to win (the whiteout is overrated). And Georgia just can't seem to beat Alabama.</p>
