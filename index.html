                <p> I spent the majority of Saturday watching college football. I woke up around 9:00,  showered, had some breakfast and a smoothie and then watched college game day up until the beginning of games. It was Michigan State’s Bye Week, and I didn’t work on Saturday, so I got to enjoy the weekend college football slate without any distractions or emotional attachments. </p>
                <p> The games I watched the early slate were Pittsburgh & Louisville, Georgia Tech & Wake Forest, Duke & Syracuse, and Notre Dame & Arkansas. One of my best friends goes to Pitt and was at the game, so he texts back and forth and lost today. I was surprised by the two ACC games, Georgia Tech just scraped by and Syracuse struggled with their backup quarterback. I think Arkansas’s head coach should be fired, they were that bad. </p>
                <p> The middle slate had some heavy hitters with Ohio State & Washington, LSU & Ole Miss, Indiana & Iowa, and Tennessee & Mississippi State. I believed Washington would put up a better fight, although they played well in the beginning and couldn't capitalize. My parents’ alma mater was Indiana, and they had a rough game at Iowa. Mississippi State lost in heartbreaking fashion in overtime, and LSU's offense looks terrible which is why they lost.</p>
                <p> The big night games were Oregon & Penn State and Alabama & Georgia. Even though it went to overtime, Oregon dominated Penn State and deserved to win (the whiteout is overrated). And Georgia just can't seem to beat Alabama.</p>

                <p> Today I had to work, I work in the fall at my ‘summer job’ in Ann Arbor which is my hometown. I work at the canoe liveries and spent most of my day cleaning the location that we closed last weekend (Argo). We ended up having some staff call out, so I did not get any help cleaning up for about three hours. Around one, I got some help from another supervisor, Jack, and we worked until four, cleaning up so that we can close for the season at Argo. Which we weren’t able to do last weekend when we were still serving customers. </p>
                <p>Cleaning and Closing up Argo included a laundry list of items That needed to get done:</p>

                    <li> trash pickup within Argo’s gates and the park</li>
                    <li> cleaning up the surrounding area of the main building</li>
                    <li> stocking boats correctly for winter</li>
                    <li> organizing the main building</li>
                    <li> organizing the shed</li>
                    <li> cleaning the staff fridge</li>
