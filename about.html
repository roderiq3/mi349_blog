                <p>
                    Hi there! My name is Francis Roderique, I am 21 years old, and I am a senior at Michigan State University. I was born on Easter! April 11th, 2004, in Bloomington, IN. On Halloween of that year, I moved to Ann Arbor where I was raised for the rest of my upbringing. I attended Bach and Burns Park elementary, Tappan middle school, and Pioneer (Ann Arbor) high school.

                <p>I would consider myself an athlete, although I do not participate in organized sports anymore, growing up I played a variety of sports and found some success in all of them.<br>Sports I played growing up:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>soccer</li>
                        <li>baseball</li>
                        <li>swimming</li>
                        <li>basketball</li>
                        <li>ice hockey</li>
                        <li>cross country</li>
                        <li>water polo</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I believe athletics are an important part of shaping people, and being involved in a variety of teams allows people to become more adaptable and malleable to do whatever they need to do, and deal with whatever life throws their way. I would consider myself a hard worker, but an introvert and I believe participating in athletics throughout my childhood helped me come out of my shell and was a space for me to be comfortable in doing so.</p>
                <p>
                    For the past five or six years I have worked in Ann Arbor at the canoe liveries at Argo and Gallup Park through the city of Ann Arbor's parks and recreation department. I have climbed the ladder within that structure and have been a supervisor for the past three seasons (years). I have written one of my blogs on this topic, as well as a blog about sports on my main page.
